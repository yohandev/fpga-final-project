# 6.2050 Final Project
## FPGA Minecraft Raytracer

This is the repository for our final project in MIT's 6.2050 FPGA class. At the root, find PDF exports of the class deliverables. `hw/` contains the SystemVerilog code which runs on a Xilinx Spartan7 FPGA. `sw/` is a software implementation of that same code (more or less), used for testing and characterizing. `plugin/` is a Java program that plugs into a standard Minecraft server.
